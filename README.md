## The Golden Rule: 

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

-- set up database to be added to the app

-- focus on homepage rendering notes first

-- after TTD render function and home page displaying correctly, work on auth page, start with sign in, check to see if user is signed in, and redirect back to home

-- when auth page is finished, work on create page to add new data to the table
-- check if user is auth, if not redirect to auth page
